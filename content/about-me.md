# Strategy + Design
Hi, I'm Ellen. I'm an experience designer and product strategist, with a bit of a coding addiction. I'm currently a Senior Designer at [Emergent Order](http://emergentorder.com), a creative agency in Austin, TX, where I work on digital products and cross-platform campaigns.

I've been designing, writing, and coding things since I first got my hands on a computer (if you're wondering, it was when Geocities was still a thing). I took a brief detour in college to learn about evolutionary biology and the human mind; I'm still hunting for interesting takes on how the mind works, what makes people happy, and how humans are wired to behave. Five years ago, those questions led me back to the design and digital world.

I get excited about solving tiny but ubiquitous problems. One of my favorite talks of all time is [Hans Rosling's Ted Talk about "magic" washing machines.](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_and_the_magic_washing_machine) If you haven't seen it, it's short and delightful and absolutely worth watching.

He makes a lot of interesting points, but the one that's always stuck with me is that the washing machine — an invention that isn't particularly exciting or sexy — is actually amazing because it creates **time.** Time to read, time to work, time to do something other than wash clothes. I often joke with my friends that I'm not really interested in saving the world; I'm interested in saving 10 minutes a day for the people who're going to figure out how to save the world 10 minutes a day faster.
