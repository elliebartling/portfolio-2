Hi! I'm Ellen. I'm an experience designer and product strategist, with a bit of a coding addiction. I'm a tinkerer and an experimenter; I like to learn by diving in the deep end. I'm currently a Senior Designer at [Emergent Order](http://emergentorder.com), a creative agency in Austin, TX, where I work on digital products and cross-platform campaigns. When I'm not at my computer, you might find me on the trails in Austin hiking with my dog, scouting a new taco joint, or testing out a new recipe.

I've been designing, writing, and coding things since I first got my hands on a computer (in case you're wondering, that was back when Geocities was still a thing). I took a brief detour in college to study evolutionary biology and the human mind, and became fascinated with how the mind works, what makes people happy, and how humans are wired to behave. Those questions led me back to the design and digital world, where I've been for the last 4 years.

*This is my dog, Gunner. He's not as enthusiastic about design, or high-fives, as I am, but he's still great.*

# Why design?

I get excited about solving tiny but ubiquitous problems. One of my favorite talks of all time is [Hans Rosling's Ted Talk about "magic" washing machines.](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_and_the_magic_washing_machine) If you haven't seen it, it's short and delightful (like everything Hans Rosling did) and absolutely worth watching:

<div id="iframe" style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_and_the_magic_washing_machine" width="854" height="480" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

He makes a lot of interesting points, but the one that's always stuck with me is that the washing machine — an invention that isn't particularly exciting or sexy — is amazing because it creates **time.** Time to read, time to work, time to become a world-renowned humanitarian and statistician. Really, time to do anything other than wash clothes.

I often joke with my friends that design is only sometimes about saving the world; the rest of the time, it's about saving 10 minutes a day for the people who're going to figure out how to save the world 10 minutes a day faster. I really love the idea that great design, no matter how small, can have a huge impact on the world.
