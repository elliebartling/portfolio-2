# interaction designer & developer

#### intro
Hi, I'm Ellen üëãüèª  I make complicated things more accessible through interactive **design.**

I'm a huge geek for all things cognitive science, user research, economics, front-end web tech, design, branding, and dogs. Currently, I work with an amazing team at an Austin, TX creative agency called Emergent Order that‚Äôs dedicated to making awesome things, including apps, websites, digital magazines, identity + branding redesign, and any kind of video production under the sun.

#### About
I design, develop and write  a lot.

In addition to designing, I also build and write ‚Äî a lot. Whether I‚Äôm prototyping animations, testing the limits of potential frameworks for a project, writing creative briefs, drawing up user research reports, or crafting proposals for new clients, I‚Äôve found that being a designer involves a lot more than designing.

_Sometimes it involves convincing unenthused dogs to high-five you._

After three years in the industry, I‚Äôve found that honing other skills makes me a much better designer and team player: learning how javascript routers work has made me a better information architect; playing with Vue.js has taught me the power of modularity and component-driven design; honing my writing has made me better at interviewing, and finding and communicating insights from user research; optimizing pages for load speed has made me better at making smart tradeoffs between form and function; and spending hours working through code has made be a better colleague, communicator, creative lead, and manager.

Design is much more than making things beautiful; I see my job as a translator between user desires, client needs, budgets, timelines, technological capabilities, and visual design. There's nothing that really mitigates the frustration of debugging Dependency Hell in a wonky npm package, or sorting through 50 magically duplicated symbols in Sketch ‚Äî but I've found that having colleageus who understand the challenges of your job, and who respect and empathize with what you do, is a kind of magic secret sauce that makes projects more fun, less stressful, and less prone to deadline-exploding misunderstandings of how features are supposed to work.
