# Hi, I'm Ellen. <br/>I'm an experience designer in Austin, TX.
Some of my skills include user research, translating research insights into concepts, UX/UI design, prototyping, front-end web development, user testing, writing, and talking to people. I've worked with brands like [Whole Foods Market](/work/at-the-fork/), Webtoon, and the [Pacific Legal Foundation](/work/pacific-legal-foundation) on experience design, user research, and product strategy projects. I’m always looking to meet new people and get involved in interesting projects. **[Say hey!](/#get-in-touch)**
