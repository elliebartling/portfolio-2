# Designer & Developer

Hi, I'm Ellen. I help organizations engage their users and build their brands through interactive design. I'm a huge geek for all things cognitive science, user research, economics, front-end web tech, design, branding, and dogs.

Currently, I work with an amazing team at an Austin, TX creative agency called Emergent Order thatâ€™s dedicated to making awesome things, including apps, websites, digital magazines, identity + branding redesign, and any kind of video production under the sun.
