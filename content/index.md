# Hi, I'm Ellen. <br/>I'm an experience designer based in Austin, TX.
Some of my skills include user research, translating insights into concepts, UX/UI design, prototyping, front-end web development, writing, and talking to people. I've worked with brands like Whole Foods Market, Webtoon, and the Pacific Legal Foundation on experience design, user research, and product strategy projects. I'm a fan of tacos, cider, and dogs.
